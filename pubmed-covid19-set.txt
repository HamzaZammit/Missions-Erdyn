AB  - A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a 
      prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take 
      medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) 
      infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has 
      rapidly spread around the world, causing (~)14 million active cases with 
      (~)582,000 deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been 
      based on a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral 
      antigen detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found 
      as the most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection 
      kits, exclusively the ones that were issued an "Emergency Use Authorization" from 
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural 
      components of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an 
      understanding of the scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods 
      that are still in the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection 
      based on the reports available so far.

AB  - The emergence of novel and evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need 
      for change in the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the 
      detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, developing rapid and 
      sensitive diagnostic technologies is now more challenging due to emerging 
      variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the infected individuals. In 
      addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and protection 
      against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed to 
      unleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its 
      associated variants. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on the 
      current challenges posed by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants 
      and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to enable their detection. In 
      addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working mechanisms, 
      advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used vaccines/therapeutic drugs and 
      their subsequent immunological impact.Key messageThe emergence of novel variants 
      of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of months, highlights one of the primary 
      challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, as well as vaccine development against 
      the virus.Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 detection include nucleic acid based, 
      antigen and immuno- assay-based and antibody-based detection methodologies for 
      efficient, robust, and quick testing; while advancements in COVID-19 preventive 
      and therapeutic strategies include novel antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and 
      SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.The varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune 
      responses induced by each one of them as well as their ability to battle 
      post-vaccination infections have all been discussed in this review.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe 
      infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the 
      pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts 
      made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many 
      countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this 
      pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, 
      surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid 
      technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, 
      the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for 
      effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its 
      spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early 
      detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside 
      test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several 
      POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the 
      centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision 
      making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different 
      nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and 
      effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive 
      information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic 
      acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • 
      Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative 
      pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by 
      March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened 
      healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average 
      incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, 
      cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a 
      mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring 
      hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. 
      However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with 
      steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, 
      an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public 
      health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of 
      countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines 
      for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral 
      drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with 
      confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics 
      and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional 
      therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
      treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive 
      research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of 
      nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed 
      for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a 
      summary of current development and future perspectives.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
      respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to millions of confirmed 
      cases and deaths worldwide. Efficient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as 
      rapid and large-scale testing plays a pivotal role in patient management and 
      decelerating disease spread. This paper reviews current technologies used to 
      detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as well as advances made for 
      molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care testing, including 
      recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance of the timing 
      and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as disease 
      prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the 
      various methodologies are presented, along with their application span and known 
      performance characteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are 
      also covered, with an emphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring 
      disease severity or complications. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly 
      evolving, this review highlights topics of interest that have occurred during the 
      pandemic and the lessons learned throughout. Exploring a broad armamentarium of 
      techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure continued diagnostic support for 
      clinicians, public health, and infection prevention and control for this pandemic 
      and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature concerning the effectiveness of the 
      COVID-19 diagnostic tools. BACKGROUND: With the absence of specific 
      treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to 
      control this infection is to quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and 
      suspected or infected cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive 
      diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, 
      limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay 
      accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important 
      tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at 
      early stage. KEY FINDINGS: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing 
      patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies 
      reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with 
      COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be 
      helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 
      has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence 
      (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia 
      diseases. CONCLUSION: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, 
      it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), 
      and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from 
      other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to 
      differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: 
      Both RT-PCR and CT tests together would increase sensitivity and improve 
      quarantine efficacy, an impact neither could achieve alone.

AB  - Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to 
      diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests cannot 
      be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid 
      antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for 
      rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with 
      RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared 
      the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient 
      specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious 
      virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of 
      virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small 
      amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral 
      antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs 
      will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 
      fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and 
      serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse 
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become 
      the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many 
      limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic 
      accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. 
      Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or 
      complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute 
      infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. 
      A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify 
      individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent 
      testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become 
      available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, 
      point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of 
      rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.

AB  - Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus 
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 
      million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The 
      COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the 
      discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal 
      coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses 
      including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), 
      and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence 
      of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of 
      mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating 
      exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels 
      from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. 
      The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses 
      from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should 
      not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, 
      virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, 
      vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 
      year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The 
      difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of 
      compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe 
      disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and 
      SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.
